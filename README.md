'Vatican City',
'Chicago'
```

## Run The App Locally

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


#### `yarn test`

Runs integration test suite for component-only integration tests and function unit tests.

#### `yarn e2e`

Builds a prod app, serves it, runs headless e2e tests against it using cypress. If cypress is not installed there is a potential that the cypress app verification will time out the runner. Running the command again should solve this problem.

### todos:

1. Add an overlay that responds to visibility data and darkens or lightens the theme.
2. Get closer to the designs in the actual styles.
