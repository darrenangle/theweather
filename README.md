This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which uses yarn by default. Stick to the yarn commands, as there is some resolution config in the package.json.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `yarn test`

Runs integration test suite for component-only integration tests and function unit tests.

### `yarn e2e`

Builds a prod app, serves it, runs headless e2e tests against it using cypress. If cypress is not installed there is a potential that the cypress app verification will time out the runner. Running the command again should solve this problem.
